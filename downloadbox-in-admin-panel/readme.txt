if you want to put downloadbox containers' web pages within iframe in panel, you can use this.  

you need to copy paste header and header sidebar modifications to related php files.  

i assumed you already did set up downloadbox from my github repo with nginx reverse proxy.  

then put all php files into panel's admin folder.  

not: jackett doesn't work in iframe, idk how to solve it.  

you must enable login authentication in radarr/sonarr... it is a public server, you can't leave them unprotected, don't be stupid.
